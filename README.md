## 🌈 Motto
_"Estamos a merced de fuerzas que desconocemos, la digitalización del dinero, la automatización del trabajo, el cambio climático, la pandemia me sirvió para abrir los ojos y descubrir que debemos confiar en la cooperación de pares, apelar a la empatía humana, a la bondad de nuestros corazones. Es el deber de la ciencia lograr cambios en la sociedad, pero es nuestro deber primero reestructurarnos a tiempo de una manera pragmática y así poder aplicar estos cambios en la sociedad, esto es de extrema importancia para estos momentos tan vertiginosos."_
